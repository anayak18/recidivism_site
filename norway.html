									<h3 id = norID>The Norweigan Prison System</h3>

										&emsp;&emsp;Norway's prisons have a strong focus on "restorative justice". The system was designed to help
										 inmates re-enter society as law-abiding citizens. The most obvious difference between the prison
										  buildings in Norway compared to other countries is the size and quality of the cells. The cells 
										  resemble dorm rooms, and prisoners often have their own bathrooms and kitchens. In accordance with
										   Norway’s desire to rehabilitate their inmates, they provide a variety of programs to their inmates. 
										   These programs can be recreational, such as yoga, wood working, and studio art, or they can help train 
										   inmates in new skills such as carpentry or computer programming which helps them find jobs after they 
										   are released. Norway has also changed their life sentencing policy, so the maximum sentence for crimes 
										   during peace time is 21 years. Prior inmates have spoken highly of their stay in prison, with some going 
										   on to publish books, receive diplomas, and continue on to higher education during or after their sentence.

										<img id = "israelimg" src="images/israelprison.jpeg" alt="Image of Israeli Prison Cell" width = "400px" style = "float:right"/>
										&emsp;&emsp;Israeli prisons seem to use more punitive measures to deter citizens from commiting crimes, as being in 
										prison is both a burden to one’s family and by no means a comforting experience. Much like American prisons, 
										Israeli prisons are extremely profitable. Food is given to all prisoners, however in every prison there is also a
										 canteen from which prisoners can purchase food. Due to insufficient funding, many inmates have described the 
										 quality and amount of food as being poor, and need to purchase food from the canteen. Inmates’ families must 
										 shoulder the cost of the food, in addition to other fines. The cells themselves are cramped and overcrowded, 
										 and sanitary conditions are poor. Rehabilitative services such as education or job training are also uncommon and 
										 poorly funded. The goal of the prison systems seems to be simply to hold prisoners until they complete their sentence,
										  and the threat of the experience itself may serve to prevent people from reoffending.

									<h3 id = chiID>The Chilean Prison System</h3>
									<h3>Out of the countries tracked, Chile placed at the <strong>50th percentile</strong>.</h3>

										<img id = "chileimg" src="images/chileprison.jpeg" alt="Image of Window of a Chilean Prison Cell" width = "400px" style = "float:right"/>
										&emsp;&emsp;The Chilean prison system, whether by intention or not, is extremely punitive to its prisoners. There is a severe 
										issue with overcrowding as a result of construction delays in new facilities which has even caused the deaths of tens of 
										inmates. The country also has harsh sentencing guidelines, but the court systems are backed up which results in people 
										waiting in prison for their trials which only land them longer sentences. There are also no effective alternatives to 
										their prisons, which contributes to the extreme overcrowding. Chile has the median rate of recidivism out of the countries 
										looked at, which means, more so than in other countries, the prison system works somewhat well to prevent it’s inmates from
										 reoffending, however there are clearly ways the country can improve.

									<h3 id = canID>The Canadian Prison System</h3>
									<h3>Out of the countries tracked, Canada placed at the <strong>75th percentile</strong>.</h3>
									</center>
									<p>
										<img id = "chileimg" src="images/canadaprison.jpeg" alt="Image of Window of a Chilean Prison Cell" width = "400px" style = "float:right"/>
										&emsp;&emsp;Candian prisons are much like those in the United States, however unlike the US, Canada does not use the
										 death penalty. Candaian prisons also heavily rely on solitary confinement, both as a punishment, and secondarily as a
										  means to “warehouse” prisoners in overcrowded facilities. The pandemic has also revealed issues within the system 
										  regarding healthcare, as COVID spread very quickly throughout prisons and it was difficult to both treat those who have
										   been infected and prevent further infection effectively. Prior inmates have also testified that they feel as though the
										    prison guards and other officials do not care about their well being, and rather seem focused on maintaining order. This
											 attitude results in the prisoners not being fully equipped for a life after their sentence is over, which may contribute 
											 to the higher rates of recidivism.

									<h3 id = danID>The Danish Prison System</h3>
									<h3>Out of the countries tracked, Denmark had the <strong>highest</strong> rate of recidivism.</h3>
									</center>
									<p>
										<img id = "chileimg" src="images/danishprison.jpeg" alt="Image of Danish Prison" width = "400px" style = "float:right"/>
										&emsp;&emsp;Danish prisons look much different than one would expect a prison to. For one, many of the prisons are “open 
										prisons”, with no barbed wire fences surrounding the buildings. This lack of security also contributes to the drug problem 
										within the prisons, with prisoners smuggling in drugs daily. Officials are aware of this problem, however they take a more 
										laid back approach to these issues, accepting the fact that there will be drugs and escaping prisoners. Danish prisoners are 
										able to attend classes, go to work, and even shop for themselves. Sentences are also light, with the average sentence being only 
										6 months. The focus of the prison system seems to be to resemble “normal” life outside of prison as closely as possible, so as to 
										prepare its prisoners for their life after they serve their sentence.
