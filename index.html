											<h3>How have prison systems changed and diversified over time?</h3>
											<p>&emsp;Prisons have always been a part of modern civilizations, as a means of containing 
												and punishing people who have committed crimes. They used to act as temporary gaps before
												excecution, but they slowly began to change into rehabilitation facilities for prisoners.
												The earliest prisons can be dated back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia;
												these prisons were often underground, and had narrow, claustraphobic passages. The ancient 
												Romans would make their prisoners fight as gladiators in a large arena for entertainment.
												<br>
												&emsp;Prison conditions remained similar to this until Henry II requested the construction of the 
												first prison after creating a justice system for Great Britain. However, the prisons became
												overcrowded within the next few years, and Britain (as well as other European countries) began
												creating alternatives to prison, including sending prisoners to penal colonies.
												<br>
												&emsp;During the 19th century, prisons became more focused on rehabilitation, and punishments like
												solitary confinement were recalled in some countries and limited to extreme crimes in others.
												World Wars I and II in the early 20th century resulted in the creation of large prison camps.
												During the 20th  century, the current system of prisons were 
												The concept of 'probation' was introduced in 1991, and 'supermax' prisons became more popular
												in the United States.

												<h2>Recidivism Rates Across the World</h2>
												<p> Recidivism rates track the rate at which people reoffend, which is a metric that is preffered to tracking the 
													amount of inmates per capita, as that number is more heavily affected by poverty. These graphs plot various 
													characteristics of a country against their rates of recidivism to observe if any of these characteristics has a 
													signficant impact on the rates of recidivism. To learn more about the specfic prison systems of
													some of the countries, visit the "case studies" tab.

											<p> <br>The data plotted on these graphs reveals no storng correlation between usage of the death penalty, poverty, or rate of imprisonment 
												on the rate of reecidivism. This indicated there are other factors that are more specific to each country that influence the rates of recidivism.
